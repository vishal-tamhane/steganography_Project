# 🖼️ Steganography Project – Hide Messages in Images 🔐

This project allows you to **hide secret messages inside images** using steganography techniques. It encodes the message at the **pixel level (LSB)** without significantly changing the image quality. Decode the image later to retrieve the hidden message.
